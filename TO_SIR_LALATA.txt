Dear Sir,
            Thank you for making this project possible. You are and will always be our favorite programming professor. We appreciate 
        the fact that you dont leave any student behind, and patiently ensure that each of us understood the lessons and are capable of applying them. It is rare to get a professor who cares so much about the future of the students. May God continue to guide you in molding the innovators of tomorrow.

Truly,
Feel Good BGYO Members
